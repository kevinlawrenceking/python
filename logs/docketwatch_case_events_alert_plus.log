Defendant Sean Combs moves to suppress evidence the Government obtained pursuant to four 2024 warrants: a January 2024 warrant to search Combs''s iCloud accounts, a March 2024 warrant to search Combs''s Los Angeles residence, a March 2024 warrant to search Combs''s Miami residence, and a March 2024 warrant to search Combs''s person and two cell phones. Dkt. 159; Dkt. 160 at 2. Combs claims there are two grounds for suppression. First, he argues that the Government''s warrant applications were "intentionally misleading," which "at a minimum[] requires a Franks hearing." Dkt. 160 at 1 (citing Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 15556 (1978)). Second, he says that the warrants were "unconstitutional general warrants." Id. at 2.

Balancing the interests at stake, the Court has already taken steps to limit what can be said publicly, including issuing an order underscoring the requirements of Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e) and Local Rule 23.1 and further requiring the Government to make those requirements clear to anyone involved in this case. See Dkt. 50. As the Court stated in that order, it will take appropriate action for violations of the rules or this Court''s order. The Court is open to other tailored proposals that will help ensure a fair trial. See Local Crim. R. 23.1(h). As to the mounting civil cases against Combs, there are further steps that he can take, including seeking relief in particular cases if the parties or their lawyers have made prejudicial statements to the press, or moving to stay those cases pending the resolution of this one, just to give two examples. However, the unprecedented relief that Combs seeks on this motion is unwarranted. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to terminate the motion at Dkt. 42.

At the November 19, 2024 hearing, defense counsel presented the Court with an intact legal pad with "Legal" written on the binding, stating that the "Legal" label on this and the other pads showed that they were clearly protected by attorney-client privilege and should not be in the Government''s possession. The Court notes that the sealed exhibit to the Government''s brief at Dkt. 72-1 includes photographs of two intact legal pads taken at the time of the BOP sweep. There is no writing on the binding of either pad. At the scheduled hearing on Friday, November 22, 2024, defense counsel should be prepared to give the Court further context on the "Legal" label that the Court was presented with at the November 19, 2024 hearing and to address why this label doesn''t appear on the photographs in the Court''s possession, and why it wasn''t addressed in defendant''s submission to the Court made a few hours before the November 19, 2024 hearing.

Defendant Sean Combs moves for discovery and an evidentiary hearing on alleged government leaks of case information (Dkt. 30). For the following reasons, the motion is DENIED. The Court is sensitive to Combs''s concern about the publication of stories claiming to disclose inside information about this case from unnamed federal law enforcement source[s] who [are] involved in the investigation." Dkt. 49-1. The Court has already taken steps in this regard, see Dkt. 50, and it is open to tailored applications for relief as this case continues. The Court once again reminds the government and its agents that if specific information comes to light showing that they leaked prohibited information, action will be taken. And the Court reminds the public that whether the government can prove Combs''s guilt in this case will turn on the evidence presented at trial, not in a trial by newspapers. Pennekamp v. Florida, 328 U.S. 331, 36163 (1946) (Frankfurter, J., concurring) ("Cases are too often tried in newspapers before they are tried in court, and the cast of characters in the newspaper trial too often differs greatly from the real persons who appear at the trial in court and who may have to suffer its distorted consequences.").

In connection with the Bureau of Prisons'' October 28, 2024 to November 1, 2024 sweep of the Metropolitan Detention Center, a BOP investigator (Investigator-1) photographed nineteen pages of Combs''s notes and sent them to the Government''s filter team. The filter team consists of AUSAs who aren''t involved in the investigation or prosecution of this case. The filter team redacted the notes and sent them to the case team. The case team consists of the agents and AUSAs investigating and prosecuting Combs. In November, the Government included some of what it received from the filter team in its opposition to Combs''s bail application, Dkt. 69, and Combs objected, arguing that those notes contained privileged information and were obtained in violation of Combs''s constitutional rights, Dkt. 70. The Court held an emergency hearing at which the Government indicated that it would not rely on the notes in opposing the bail application. See Dkt. 88 at 24:1325:1. The Court ordered the case team to get rid of the notes in its possession, which it did. Dkt. 76. Combs has now filed a motion for an evidentiary hearing and other relief, arguing that the seizure of his notes violated the Fourth Amendment, and that the Government intentionally obtained his privileged communications in violation of the Sixth Amendment. Dkts. 97, 98. In response to the motion, the Government argues that there were no violations but also that it won''t offer as evidence the notes or any fruits of the notes. Dkt. 117 at 8. In a December 20, 2024 ex parte letter (the contents of which were later shared with the defense), the Government outlined certain investigative steps taken upon receiving the notes, but it represented that it "will not offer the evidence obtained pursuant to these investigative steps in the prosecution of the defendant," and that it "intends to produce the evidence [obtained from these steps] to the defendant, to the extent it has not already."...[*** See this Opinion And Order ***]...

Combs asks for the identities of the anonymized victims and witnesses identified in the Government''s RICO enterprise letter, reprising and expanding his October 2024 motion for a bill of particulars for victim names. The Government doesnt oppose disclosure of this information; it makes clear that it plans to turn this information over to Combs on March 21, 2025, the date on the schedule for the Governments disclosure of 3500 material under an Attorney Eyes Only designation. Because this dispute has narrowed to whether disclosure should happen now or in a couple weeks, the interests that would normally counsel against immediate disclosure have abated. The Government has the information, doesnt identify any logistical issues in turning it over earlier, and in fact plans to do so shortly, minimizing any concerns about witness tampering and the like based on advance disclosure. On the other hand, Combs emphasizes that there is a tremendous volume of information that has and will be produced, and every day counts for preparation with trial two months away. For these reasons, and balancing the parties'' interests, the Court grants the motion and orders the Government to provide the requested information, under an Attorney Eyes Only designation, on or before March 10, 2025. The Clerk of Court is respectfully requested to terminate Dkt. 36. (Signed by Judge Arun Subramanian on 3/6/25) (jw) (Entered: 03/06/2025)

Consolidated Defendant The New York Times Company ("NY Times") moves, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(c), for a stay of discovery as it relates to the NY Times pending a decision on its motion to dismiss. Dkt. No. 109. The motion is granted. As further set forth in this Order. Those issues will invariably be affected by the Court''s decision on the motion to dismiss. Finally, the Wayfarer Parties are unlikely to be unfairly prejudiced by a stay while the Court decides the pending motion. The NY Times did not delay filing its motion; it filed the motion within 21 days of being served. The Court intends to address the motion to dismiss promptly after it is fully submitted. To the extent that the Wayfarer Parties are concerned about delay, they have it within their power to accelerate their contemplated further amended complaint or their opposition to the motion to dismiss. The Wayfarer Parties themselves suggest that discovery from the NY Times is unlikely to be voluminous. Dkt. No. 117 at 2. To the extent discovery is sought from the NY Times as a defendant, it can be requested if and when the Court denies the pending motion to dismiss. In the meantime, it is evident that the parties will be busy with document discovery from the other parties and with third party discovery. Depositions are not anticipated to begin soon. The Court hopes to decide the motion well before they do begin. The motion to stay discovery as it relates to the NY Times is GRANTED. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to close Dkt. No. 109. SO ORDERED.. (Signed by Judge Lewis J. Liman on 3/4/2025) Filed In Associated Cases: 1:24-cv-10049-LJL, 1:25-cv-00449-LJL (ks) Modified on 3/4/2025 (ks). (Entered: 03/04/2025)

Dkt. 159; Dkt. 160 at 2. Combs claims there are two grounds for suppression. First, he argues that the Government''s warrant applications were "intentionally misleading," which "at a minimum[] requires a Franks hearing." Dkt. 160 at 1 (citing Franks v.

Balancing the interests at stake, the Court has already taken steps to limit what can be said publicly, including issuing an order underscoring the requirements of Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e) and Local Rule 23.1 and further requiring the Government to make those requirements clear to anyone involved in this case. See Dkt. 50. As the Court stated in that order, it will take appropriate action for violations of the rules or this Court''s order. The Court is open to other tailored proposals that will help ensure a fair trial. See Local Crim. R. 23.1(h). As to the mounting civil cases against Combs, there are further steps that he can take, including seeking relief in particular cases if the parties or their lawyers have made prejudicial statements to the press, or moving to stay those cases pending the resolution of this one, just to give two examples. However, the unprecedented relief that Combs seeks on this motion is unwarranted. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to terminate the motion at Dkt. 42.

Dkt. 75 at 1. The letter also described the legal pads in detail and argued that they were privileged in part because "[o]n top of his legal pads and notes, [defendant] has a folder marked ''legal,''" which "put anyone on notice that everything along with the folder marked ''legal'' isattorney-client material[]." Id. at 12. At the November 19, 2024 hearing, defense counsel presented the Court with an intact legal pad with "Legal" written on the binding, stating that the "Legal" label on this and the other pads showed that they were clearly protected by attorney-client privilege and should not be in the Government''s possession. The Court notes that the sealed exhibit to the Government''s brief at Dkt. 72-1 includes photographs of two intact legal pads taken at the time of the BOP sweep. There is no writing on the binding of either pad. At the scheduled hearing on Friday, November 22, 2024, defense counsel should be prepared to give the Court further context on the "Legal" label that the Court was presented with at the November 19, 2024 hearing and to address why this label doesn''t appear on the photographs in the Court''s possession, and why it wasn''t addressed in defendant''s submission to the Court made a few hours before the November 19, 2024 hearing.

Defendant Sean Combs moves for discovery and an evidentiary hearing on alleged government leaks of case information (Dkt. 30). For the following reasons, the motion is DENIED. The Court is sensitive to Combs''s concern about the publication of stories claiming to disclose inside information about this case from unnamed federal law enforcement source[s] who [are] involved in the investigation." Dkt. 49-1. The Court has already taken steps in this regard, see Dkt. 50, and it is open to tailored applications for relief as this case continues. The Court once again reminds the government and its agents that if specific information comes to light showing that they leaked prohibited information, action will be taken. And the Court reminds the public that whether the government can prove Combs''s guilt in this case will turn on the evidence presented at trial, not in a trial by newspapers. Pennekamp v. Florida, 328 U.S. 331, 36163 (1946) (Frankfurter, J., concurring) ("Cases are too often tried in newspapers before they are tried in court, and the cast of characters in the newspaper trial too often differs greatly from the real persons who appear at the trial in court and who may have to suffer its distorted consequences.").

In connection with the Bureau of Prisons'' October 28, 2024 to November 1, 2024 sweep of the Metropolitan Detention Center, a BOP investigator (Investigator-1) photographed nineteen pages of Combs''s notes and sent them to the Government''s filter team. The filter team consists of AUSAs who aren''t involved in the investigation or prosecution of this case. The filter team redacted the notes and sent them to the case team. The case team consists of the agents and AUSAs investigating and prosecuting Combs. In November, the Government included some of what it received from the filter team in its opposition to Combs''s bail application, Dkt. 69, and Combs objected, arguing that those notes contained privileged information and were obtained in violation of Combs''s constitutional rights, Dkt. 70. The Court held an emergency hearing at which the Government indicated that it would not rely on the notes in opposing the bail application. See Dkt. 88 at 24:1325:1. The Court ordered the case team to get rid of the notes in its possession, which it did. Dkt. 76. Combs has now filed a motion for an evidentiary hearing and other relief, arguing that the seizure of his notes violated the Fourth Amendment, and that the Government intentionally obtained his privileged communications in violation of the Sixth Amendment. Dkts. 97, 98. In response to the motion, the Government argues that there were no violations but also that it won''t offer as evidence the notes or any fruits of the notes. Dkt. 117 at 8. In a December 20, 2024 ex parte letter (the contents of which were later shared with the defense), the Government outlined certain investigative steps taken upon receiving the notes, but it represented that it "will not offer the evidence obtained pursuant to these investigative steps in the prosecution of the defendant," and that it "intends to produce the evidence [obtained from these steps] to the defendant, to the extent it has not already."...[*** See this Opinion And Order ***]...

Combs asks for the identities of the anonymized victims and witnesses identified in the Government''s RICO enterprise letter, reprising and expanding his October 2024 motion for a bill of particulars for victim names. The Government doesnt oppose disclosure of this information; it makes clear that it plans to turn this information over to Combs on March 21, 2025, the date on the schedule for the Governments disclosure of 3500 material under an Attorney Eyes Only designation. Because this dispute has narrowed to whether disclosure should happen now or in a couple weeks, the interests that would normally counsel against immediate disclosure have abated. The Government has the information, doesnt identify any logistical issues in turning it over earlier, and in fact plans to do so shortly, minimizing any concerns about witness tampering and the like based on advance disclosure. On the other hand, Combs emphasizes that there is a tremendous volume of information that has and will be produced, and every day counts for preparation with trial two months away. For these reasons, and balancing the parties'' interests, the Court grants the motion and orders the Government to provide the requested information, under an Attorney Eyes Only designation, on or before March 10, 2025. The Clerk of Court is respectfully requested to terminate Dkt. 36. (Signed by Judge Arun Subramanian on 3/6/25) (jw) (Entered: 03/06/2025)

Consolidated Defendant The New York Times Company ("NY Times") moves, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(c), for a stay of discovery as it relates to the NY Times pending a decision on its motion to dismiss. Dkt. No. 109. The motion is granted. As further set forth in this Order. Those issues will invariably be affected by the Court''s decision on the motion to dismiss. Finally, the Wayfarer Parties are unlikely to be unfairly prejudiced by a stay while the Court decides the pending motion. The NY Times did not delay filing its motion; it filed the motion within 21 days of being served. The Court intends to address the motion to dismiss promptly after it is fully submitted. To the extent that the Wayfarer Parties are concerned about delay, they have it within their power to accelerate their contemplated further amended complaint or their opposition to the motion to dismiss. The Wayfarer Parties themselves suggest that discovery from the NY Times is unlikely to be voluminous. Dkt. No. 117 at 2. To the extent discovery is sought from the NY Times as a defendant, it can be requested if and when the Court denies the pending motion to dismiss. In the meantime, it is evident that the parties will be busy with document discovery from the other parties and with third party discovery. Depositions are not anticipated to begin soon. The Court hopes to decide the motion well before they do begin. The motion to stay discovery as it relates to the NY Times is GRANTED. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to close Dkt. No. 109. SO ORDERED.. (Signed by Judge Lewis J. Liman on 3/4/2025) Filed In Associated Cases: 1:24-cv-10049-LJL, 1:25-cv-00449-LJL (ks) Modified on 3/4/2025 (ks). (Entered: 03/04/2025)

(See Dkts. 437, 438, 439, 441, 444, 459, 461.) Plaintiffs also have requested adverse inferences and other sanctions for Defendants'' failure to sufficiently respond to asset discovery. (See Dkts. 452, 458.) Plaintiffs have not, however, filed a comprehensive brief or supporting affidavits (as they did in the cases before Judge Rakoff) as would support the relief sought. Accordingly, by June 5, 2025, Plaintiffs shall file (1) a brief legally supporting ownership, turnover, and sale of all assets that are the subject of Defendants'' previous correspondence (and any additional assets that are at issue); (2) supporting affidavit(s) and exhibits; and (3) any draft order(s) Plaintiffs propose be entered. Among other matters, the brief shall identify for each asset at issue, the proof Plaintiff relies on to determine ownership of the respective asset. That proof may include, inter alia, proposed adverse inferences based on Defendants'' failure to comply with discovery.

If Defendants fail to comply, the Court will find Defendants in contempt and may issue an arrest warrant for Mr. Dash to bring him to Court to respond to the discovery sought. Additionally, sanctions will be imposed, which may include drawing adverse inferences, preclusion, and/or monetary sanctions. Defense counsel asserts that his clients have not responded to multiple attempts to reach them and have not cooperated in responding to the discovery requests served. (Dkt. 455.) For that reason, defense counsel seeks to withdraw and requests a stay of 30 days for Defendants to have the opportunity to retain new counsel. Additionally,for that reason and due to Dash''s purported forthcoming bankruptcy, defense counsel argues that the parties "should just wait until the bankruptcy filing is made." Defense counsel is granted leave to file a motion to withdraw. The application must comply with SDNY Local Rule 1.4 and be supported by a detailed affidavit that sets forth the facts underlying the reasons that counsel offers as a basis for withdrawal. To the extent the affidavit, or other material, contains material that is confidential as between client and attorney, counsel shall submit a redacted copy on the public record and an unredacted version to the Court for in camera review. Even though the Court grants defense counsel leave to file the motion, that should not be taken as an indication that it necessarily will be granted. The motion shall be filed by May 16, 2025. Any opposition shall be filed by May 23, 2025. Defense counsel''s request for a stay at this time is denied. As Plaintiffs correctly point out (Dkt. 456), Defendants have been and remain engaged in drawing out and evading enforcement proceedings. Defendants'' lack of cooperation and request for a stay appear to be the latest elements of that strategy. Moreover, there is no reason to believe that Defendants would cooperate with new counsel any more than with current counsel, who has represented Defendants in these proceedings since they began approximately six years ago.

P.S.-Mr Brown should stop writing me letters. I will not read them. I do not care to see the content feed of instagrams. You be professional.

Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs'' motion for a preliminary injunction is GRANTED. Dash is hereby temporarily enjoined from marketing, advertising, or publicly promoting the Film in any fashion during the pendency of this case. As the Court told the parties at the preliminary injunction hearing, the parties should consider whether, in view of their mutual interests in resolving any dispute over ownership of the Film as quickly as possible, it would be in their best interest to proceed to trial on an expedited basis. As the Court would be unavailable in the short term, it strongly recommends that the parties consent to have this matter heard by the Hon. Robert W. Lehrburger, United States Magistrate Judge. If the parties so prefer, they should consent to proceed before him pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(c) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 73. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to remove Dkt.

All of Plaintiffs'' pending motions - motion for civil contempt (Dkt. No. 49); motion to dismiss Defendants'' counterclaim (Dkt. No. 51); motion for summary judgment on Plaintiffs'' defamation claims (Dkt. No. 57); and motion for summary judgment on Plaintiffs'' copyright claim (Dkt. No. 63) - are denied. The motion for civil contempt is denied as frivolous - a single screen shot from the disputed film (not identified with the movie), posted on Instagram as part of the advertising of Defendant Damon Dash''s website (not the movie) is not a violation of the Court''s order directing Dash not to market the film. (See Dkt. No. 46.) The motions for summary judgement are denied because, as should be clear from the Court''s opinion granting Plaintiffs'' motion for a preliminary injunction, there are disputed issues of material fact in this case that will require a trial. The motion to dismiss the counterclaim is denied because the counterclaim - which seeks a declaration that Dash is a co-author of the work - is simply the inverse of Plaintiffs'' infringement claim. So, if there are issues of fact on the copyright claim, there are equally issues of fact on the counterclaim. The parties must complete discovery by June 21, 2019 and file a proposed joint pretrial order in accordance with the Court''s individual rules no later than July 12, 2019. They will then be on two days'' notice for trial. I again urge them to stipulate to trial before the Hon. Robert W. Lehrburger, United States Magistrate Judge. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to terminate the open motions at ECF Nos. 49, 51, 57, and 63. It is so ordered. (Signed by Judge Colleen McMahon on 3/21/2019) (mml) (Entered: 03/21/2019)

(3)The Court''s order dated August 6, 209 (Dkt. 95) was not intended to grant Defendant permission to take depositions the right to which previously had been forfeited; Plaintiff previously noticed the deposition of Defendant during the discovery period; Defendant did not; as Defendant concedes "the issue of depositions never came up in this litigation save Plaintiff''s request to do Defendants'' deposition in Boston" (Dkt. 96 at 3); accordingly, Defendant has forfeited his opportunity to depose Plaintiffs; however, Defendant has not forfeited his right to take the deposition of Plaintiffs in regard to the information that came to light on July 24, 2019, namely, social media posting regarding the upcoming screening of the film allegedly at issue in this case; accordingly, Defendant may take Plaintiffs'' depositions about the film that is to be screened.

However, the Court has no affidavit or other admissible evidence before it by which to determine the current state of affairs. Accordingly, the Court does find it appropriate to find Defendants in contempt at this time. However, to the extent the posts have not otherwise been removed, the Court hereby orders Defendants to remove them no later than February 12, 2020. Failure to comply with this Order, as well as any further violation of the terms of the Preliminary Injunction will be deemed contempt of court and subject to sanctions. See Brooks v. Dash, No. 19-cv-1944 at Dkt. 62 (S.D.N.Y.) (similar order issued by Judge Rakoff). SO ORDERED. (Signed by Magistrate Judge Robert W. Lehrburger on 2/10/2020) (mml) (Entered: 02/10/2020)

Accordingly, Plaintiffs'' application is denied without prejudice, and: 1. The parties shall await the Court''s ruling on Plaintiffs'' summary judgment motions. In the event either of Plaintiffs'' summary judgment motions is denied, Dash must appear for continuation of his deposition; the deposition will take place at the Federal Courthouse at 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY; Dash will pay for all costs of the deposition, including but not limited to Plaintiff counsel''s reasonable travel expenses as well as the cost for the court reporter and videographer. 2. To the extent Dash has not produced documents or interrogatory responses as required, the Court will entertain application (to be made at the time for submission of trial in limine motions) for adverse inferences to be made at trial.

Once again, Defendant Dash has frustrated completing his deposition, and the fact that he was the only person involved in the deposition who could not be clearly heard is highly suspect. That said, the Court cannot conclude from the transcript submitted, the videographer''s affidavit (which is not notarized) and Plaintiffs affidavit (also not notarized), that the problems with Dashs audibility were intentionally caused by Dash purposefully speaking in a low voice behind the two masks he was wearing. The transcript reflects several instances where Dashs testimony is recorded, where Dash directly answered the question asked, and where Dash apparently brought the microphone in closer proximity to his face. There also are no recorded instances where Dash expressed his desire to be elsewhere or that he did not have time to be at the deposition. Accordingly, the motions for terminating sanctions are denied without prejudice. Defendants'' request for sanctions is denied. The parties shall cooperate to complete Mr. Dash''s deposition by March 10, 2021. The burden is on Dash to make sure that the deposition is completed without incident. Failure to comply with this order may result in sanctions, including termination sanctions. SO ORDERED. (Deposition due by 3/10/2021.) (Signed by Magistrate Judge Robert W.

This order resolves Plaintiff''s motion for termination sanctions and legal fees (Dkt. 193) and Defendant Dash''s response to the motion (Dkt. 196). Dash''s assertion of confidentiality in response to the deposition questions posed to him regarding transfer of assets was improper; even assuming any information sought was confidential to third parties (a dubious proposition), the proper course would have been to designate as confidential in this case that portion of the testimony. That said, termination sanctions and a fee award are not commensurate to the transgression. The asset transfer issue is not relevant to the merits of the case. In the event that Plaintiffs obtain a judgment awarding damages in their favor and Defendant does not satisfy it, Plaintiff may pursue discovery of asset transfers as part of discovery to enforce the judgment. 2. Discovery is now closed. Plaintiffs shall file their motions for summary judgment, bearing in mind prior summary judgment decisions in this matter. Plaintiffs indicated on March 16, 2021 (Dkt. 192) that they would file their motions by March 31, 2021.

By September 23, 2021, the parties shall notify the Court as to any weeks they are not available for trial during the first quarter of 2022. Due to the ongoing pandemic-related conditions, trial dates are centrally coordinated, jury trials are limited to a select group of reconfigured courtrooms, and criminal trials take precedent over civil trials. The Court thus can request a particular date for trial but there is no guarantee trial will go forward on that date. Nonetheless, counsel must be fully prepared to proceed on the scheduled date. If the parties consent to a bench trial, the Court can provide a firm, and earlier, trial date. In the event that the parties request a bench trial, the dates of non-availability provided to the Court should include November and December of this year in addition to first quarter 2022.

By October 4, 2021, Plaintiff will file a letter addressing whether Defendant has a right to trial by jury. By October 7, 2021, Defendant shall file a letter responding on the jury trial issue as well as the estoppel issue raised by Plaintiff in Dkt. 228. The parties should plan on trial by jury unless and until the Court determines that there is no right to trial by jury, or the parties otherwise agree to waive their right to trial by jury. 2. Trial will be scheduled for January 24-28, 2022. To the extent trial proceeds by jury (rather than as a bench trial), scheduling is subject to assignment by the Court''s jury trial coordination process during pandemic conditions, which means that three trials will be scheduled to start the same day, of which this case will be one. Criminal trials are prioritized over civil trials. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that trial will go forward on the scheduled date. Nevertheless, the parties must be prepared to begin trial as scheduled and also be prepared for going forward at any alternative date set by the Court. 3. A date for final pre-trial conference, to take approximately one week before trial, will be scheduled by my Deputy Clerk in coordination with the parties. 4. By December 1, 2021, the parties shall, in compliance with my individual rules, file the requisite proposed pre-trial order, jury materials (or, bench trial filings in the event of a bench trial), and motions in limine. Opposition to motions in limine shall be filed by December 15, 2021. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Magistrate Judge Robert W.

ENDORSEMENT: The Court cannot set trial for the date requested by counsel.

The Court previously requested from the jury trial coordinator for the Southern District of New York a trial setting of March 1-4, 2022. That request was not granted in light of the number of criminal and other cases in need of jury trial dates. The jury trial coordinator has now slated trial of this matter beginning Thursday March 24, 2022. It is possible that date could be moved up to earlier in the week. At the same time, the case is scheduled as a backup on the list for jury trials on that date. This means that the case will not proceed if a trial scheduled ahead of this one goes forward. If the case cannot proceed on the scheduled date, the Court will seek another jury trial date for as soon as possible thereafter. In any event, the parties must be trial ready as of March 21, 2022. As soon as the Court can confirm that the matter will proceed on March 24, 2022 (or earlier that week), it will inform the parties. As previously explained to the parties, the Court can be more flexible in setting a trial date if the matter proceeds as a bench trial. SO ORDERED. Copies transmitted this date to all counsel of record. Ready for Trial by 3/21/2022. (Signed by Magistrate Judge Robert W. Lehrburger on 12/3/2021) (mml) (Entered: 12/03/2021)

As discussed during the pre-trial conference held on March 18, 2022, the Court has resolved the parties'' motions in limine as follows. To the extent not reflected herein, the Courts rulings are reflected in the recording of the conference. 1. Estoppel: Plaintiffs have renewed their request that the Court afford collateral estoppel effect to the determination in the California case Brown v. Dash as to Dash''s liability for defamation. Although one of the statements at issue in this case is the same statement at issue in the California case, the issues in the two cases are distinctly different. In the California case, the question was whether the statement was false as to Brown. In the instant case, the question is whether the statement is false as to Muddy Water Pictures and Josh Webber. Accordingly, collateral estoppel does not apply, and Plaintiff''s request is denied. 2. Dominant Authorship: Plaintiff moves in limine to preclude Defendants from arguing that they are the dominant author of the film at issue. Plaintiff argues that Defendants have asserted only that they are joint authors of the film along with Muddy Water Pictures. This motion is denied. If the jury determines that the parties are not joint authors, it will go on to determine who is the dominant author. Although the copyright registration provides Muddy Water Pictures with the presumption of ownership, it does not preclude consideration of the dominant author question. 3. Plaintiffs Exhibits: Exhibits 1, 5, 6, 7: Objections sustained except that the exhibits attached to those documents are admissible. Exhibit 4: Defendant stipulates that Poppington LLC is a New York entity registered in New York; accordingly, the objection is over-ruled, although there should be no need for the exhibit to be introduced during testimony. Exhibits 14-15 (videos): Objection pending determination on Defendants'' Exhibits 3-6. Exhibits 17, 22, 26, 30, 31, 32: Objections sustained. All other exhibits admitted, subject to meet and confer about completeness/context. 4. Defendants'' Exhibits: Exhibits 3-6: Subject to letter briefing as described below. Exhibit 11: Parties to meet and confer about whether previously produced. All other exhibits admitted. 5. Updated Exhibit List: The parties shall file an updated exhibit list no later than Monday March 21, 2022. 6. Letter Briefing: By March 22, 2022, the parties shall submit letters of no more than four pages each addressing the unresolved evidentiary issues, namely: (i) admissibility of fact of outcome in Brooks v Dash for purposes of challenging Defendants'' credibility; (ii) admissibility of Defendants'' Exhibits 3-6 ; (iii) whether Defendants'' Exhibit 11 was previously produced, and status of Plaintiff''s objection thereto. 7. The parties shall redact lawyer-client communications from all exhibits. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Magistrate Judge Robert W. Lehrburger on 3/18/2022) (mml) (Entered: 03/18/2022)

Siev as counsel for Mr. Carter and indicating that Mr. Siev was voted to act as secretary for purposes of the meeting. (Dkt. 351 at 6.) The parties are advised that Mr. Siev is indirectly related to me by marriage and that I see and converse with Mr. Siev at family gatherings. I do not believe that this fact creates a conflict of interest requiring recusal, but the parties should consider that Mr. Siev conceivably (even if unlikely) could be a witness at some point in these proceedings and otherwise represented and may continue to represent one of the three principals of RAF. Accordingly, the parties and RAF shall meet and confer to address whether any party (including RAF) objects to my continued assignment to this case and requests that I recuse myself. By October 16, 2023, the parties shall jointly file a letter indicating whether any party so objects and requests my recusal. In the event, a party does so object and request my recusal, the letter shall not identify the objecting party but shall simply state that one or more of the parties objects and requests my recusal. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Magistrate Judge Robert W. Lehrburger on 10/5/2023) (mml) (Entered: 10/05/2023)

This order resolves certain letter motions in connection with the upcoming auction of judgment-debtor Dash''s ownership interest in Roc-A-Fella Records, Inc. ("RAF") for purposes of enforcing the judgment obtained by Plaintiffs. 1. Stay Of Auction: Intervenor NYCDSS''s motion to stay the auction for purposes of having this Court determine the validity of the copyright termination notice filed by Shawn Carter a/k/a Jay-Z in connection with the work Reasonable Doubt, an asset owned by RAF, is DENIED. (See Dkt. 410, 412, 415, 419), as further set forth. 2. Discovery From RAF: Intervenor NYCDSS''s motion to compel discovery of RAF is DENIED, as further set forth. 3. Roy Intervention: The motion of Rachel Roy to intervene is GRANTED IN PART. (See Dkt. 401, 418.) Plaintiffs and Defendants both object to Roy''s intervention. (See Dkt. 405, 407, 420.) Intervenor NYCDSS has also weighed in (posing no objection). (See Dkt. 408), as further set forth. 4. Conduct Of Auction: NYCDSS has raised concerns about certain aspects of conduct of the auction. (See Dkt. 412 at 2-3.) The information provided by NYCDSS from the state Sheriff''s office is not apt, as the U.S. Marshal Service, not the Sheriffs office, will be conducting the auction. Plaintiffs have provided information from the U.S. Marshal Service about how the auction may and will be conducted. (See Dkt. 414.) The auction shall take place pursuant to the oversight, procedures, and approvals of the U.S. Marshal Service, including with respect to filming (allowable), bidder''s deposit (required), and location (hotel). The Court will separately address the reserve issue after receiving further submissions. The Clerk of Court is directed to terminate the letter motions at Dkt. 401 and 410.
